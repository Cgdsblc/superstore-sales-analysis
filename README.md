# Superstore Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of the Superstore Sales dataset, aiming to uncover insights into customer spending patterns. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python, as well as SQL queries and Tableau. The goal is to identify customer segments based on their spending behavior and create visualizations to better understand sales trends.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Folder containing the Superstore Sales dataset (CSV, XLS and DB files).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook with Python (+ SQL) codes for data analysis.
- `tableau/`: Tableau Workbook (only .png, neither .twbx nor .pdf) file for the dashboard.
- `visualization/`: Visualization file for the graphs and the dashboard.

## Tools and Languages Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQLite
- Tableau

# Steps

1. Data Collection
- Utilized the Superstore Sales dataset available at (https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls).
2. Data Cleaning and Exploration (Python)
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Checked for and handled missing values.
- Explored basic statistics of the dataset.
- Created visualizations to understand sales patterns.
3. Data Analysis (SQL)
- Executed SQL queries to gain deeper insights into customer spending.
- Analyzed customer segments based on their total spending.
4. Data Visualization (Tableau)
- Created visualizations in Python to showcase sales trends.
- Explored customer segments and spending patterns.
- Connected to the dataset in Tableau.
- Explored data visually using sheets.
- Created dashboards to showcase analyses.

## Results

- Key findings and results are summarized in the respective analysis sections.
- Detailed visualizations can be explored in the provided visualization files.

## GitHub Repository

https://github.com/Cgdsblc/superstore-sales-analysis

## How to Use

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the Python code and visualizations.
- Execute SQL queries in your preferred SQL environment using the provided queries.

## Future Steps

- The analysis could be extended by integrating additional datasets or refining visualizations.
- Further exploration into customer segments and personalized marketing strategies.

## Challenges Faced

- Challenges related to data quality and missing values were addressed during the data cleaning process.
- Challenges faced while saving the Tableau Dashboard. Tableau Public saving is crashed while trying to cancel after a long time waiting. Therefore, there are not .twbx or .pdf format in the tableau folder, only Dashboard ss as .png format.

Feel free to explore, analyze, and provide feedback!
